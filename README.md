## Recordings
I will be posting recordings for lectures/labs (assuming I don't forget to record them) on google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yGJxK9ncTRYE8BOlHHiTGdSUp8bdK34L?usp=sharing

## TMB
We will be using Template Model Builder in every lecture/lab and for all homeworks/projects.  Please install prior to attending the first class, following instructions at: https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/geostatistical_delta-GLMM/wiki/Steps-to-install-TMB
